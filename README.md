## Overview

**GovData Insights** is a GovTech solution aimed at transforming large volumes of public data into actionable insights. The platform will:
- **Integrate Data:** Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from public sources (e.g., transparency portals) into a consolidated repository.
- **Analyze Data:** Apply machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and predict trends in public spending.
- **Visualize Insights:** Provide interactive, responsive dashboards that empower decision-makers with data-driven insights.

This project is built following a constructivist approach, where each learning step builds on the previous ones. The development is guided by best practices in Clean Code, TDD, and agile methodologies.

## Project Features

- **ETL & Data Integration:**  
  Use Pentaho Data Integration to extract and transform data from multiple public sources, storing structured data in PostgreSQL and semi-structured data in MongoDB.

- **Back-end & API Development:**  
  Develop RESTful APIs using Python (with Flask or Django) to orchestrate data flows, integrate machine learning models, and provide secure, documented endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI).

- **Modern Front-end:**  
  Build a web application with Next.js using React and TypeScript. This ensures server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved performance and SEO.

- **Machine Learning & Data Analysis:**  
  Implement predictive models using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow/PyTorch to detect anomalies and forecast trends.

- **DevOps & Environment Standardization:**  
  Utilize Docker to containerize development environments and configure CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.

- **Testing & Code Quality:**  
  Follow TDD practices with comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, along with Clean Code principles to ensure maintainable, high-quality code.
